## Process

-   Pull data from remote database with pyodbc; save as csv files

-   Develop questions and a hypothesis to base analysis of the project on

-   Understand the data and make decisions on how to process the data

-   Data preprocessing, cleaning and merging- The data was very messy and 90% of the project involved cleaning and making the data ready for analysis and visualizations

-   Visualise the data with seaborn and pyplot

-   Created a PowerBI dashboard with the visualizations

-   Wrote a medium article and briefly described the process, findings and recommendations
