## Project Description
In this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.
The data for this project is in a csv format. The following describes the columns present in the data.

- **Gender**-- Whether the customer is a male or a female 

- **SeniorCitizen** -- Whether a customer is a senior citizen or not

- **Partner** -- Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No)

- **Dependents** -- Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No)

- **Tenure** -- Number of months the customer has stayed with the company

- **Phone Service** -- Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No)

- **MultipleLines** -- Whether the customer has multiple lines or not

- **InternetService** -- Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber Optic, No)

- **OnlineSecurity** -- Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No Internet)

- **OnlineBackup** -- Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No Internet)

- **DeviceProtection** -- Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service)

- **TechSupport** -- Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet)

- **StreamingTV** -- Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service)

- **StreamingMovies** -- Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No Internet service)

- **Contract** -- The contract term of the customer (Month-to-Month, One year, Two year)

- **PaperlessBilling** -- Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No)

- **Payment Method** -- The customer's payment method (Electronic check, mailed check, Bank transfer(automatic), Credit card(automatic))

- **MonthlyCharges** -- The amount charged to the customer monthly

- **TotalCharges** -- The total amount charged to the customer

- **Churn** -- Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No)

## Process

-   Pull data from remote database with pyodbc; save as csv files

-   Develop questions and a hypothesis to base analysis of the project on

-   Understand the data and make decisions on how to process the data

-   Data preprocessing, cleaning and merging- The data was very messy and 90% of the project involved cleaning and making the data ready for analysis and visualizations

-   Visualise the data with seaborn and pyplot

-   Created a PowerBI dashboard with the visualizations

-   Wrote a medium article and briefly described the process, findings and recommendations

## Instruction:
Your task is to understand the data and prepare it for model building. Your analysis or methods should incorporate the following steps.

1. Hypothesis formation and Data Processing - Importing the relevant libraries and modules, Cleaning of Data, Check data types, Encoding Data labels etc.

2. Data Evaluation -- Perform bivariate and multivariate analysis, EDA

3. See attached some useful resources [ Exploratory Data Analysis: Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis , Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis , Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python]

4. Build & Select Model -- Train Model on dataset and select the best performing model.

5. Evaluate your chosen Model.

6. Model Improvement.

7. Future Predictions.

8. Key Insights and Conclusion.

Upon completion of your project, you are required to write a blog post on your thought process on medium, LinkedIn, personal blog, or any other suitable blogging site.
